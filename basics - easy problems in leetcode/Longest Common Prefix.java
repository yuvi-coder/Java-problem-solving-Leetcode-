//  sort() : https://www.scaler.com/topics/lexicographical-order-in-java/

Arrays.sort(strs);   //  -- the line in the above program. EXPLANATION BELOW

/*  This line sorts the array of strings *lexicographically (dictionary order)*.

Think of how words appear in a dictionary:

"apple" < "banana" < "car"

Also "abc" < "abd" because it compares characters from left to right.

Example:
    
Before sorting: ["flower", "flow", "flight"]
After sorting: ["flight", "flow", "flower"] 

So now:

strs[0] = "flight"

strs[strs.length - 1] = "flower"

These two strings will be the most different, because they are the "smallest" and "largest" lexicographically.    */



String s1 = strs[0];
String s2 = strs[strs.length - 1];   // -- the line in the program.  EXPLAINATION BELOW

/* Now we're comparing only the first and last strings in the sorted array, because if there's any difference between
strings, it will be maximized between these two. */

// Why? Because sorting brings the most dissimilar prefixes to the edges.


while (idx < s1.length() && idx < s2.length()) {   //-- the line in the program.  EXPLAINATION BELOW
    
/* This condition ensures:
We're within *bounds* for both s1 and s2 strings.
We're comparing character by character.

Example:
s1 = "flight"
s2 = "flower"

At index 0: 'f' == 'f' → idx = 1

At index 1: 'l' == 'l' → idx = 2

At index 2: 'i' != 'o' → Break the loop.  -- NOTE

Now, idx = 2 */


return s1.substring(0, idx);    //-- the line in the program.  EXPLAINATION BELOW

/* This returns the substring from index 0 to idx (excluding idx itself). So in our example:

s1.substring(0, 2) = "fl"

❓ What if there’s no common prefix?
If s1 and s2 have no common characters at the start:

Loop breaks at idx = 0

So s1.substring(0, 0) → returns an empty string ("") */

/* And yes, to your question:

"Does this line print an empty string if there are no string elements in the original string s1?"

If the array is empty (i.e., strs.length == 0), *this code will throw an exception (ArrayIndexOutOfBounds)* because
it tries to access strs[0] without checking if the array is empty.  */

// You should ideally add a check at the start:  
    if (strs == null || strs.length == 0) return "";  // -- additional code to be considered.

Arrays.sort(strs) :
/*
* It sorts strings alphabetically, based on Unicode values.
* After sorting, the first and last strings are the most different, so comparing just those two is enough to find the common prefix across all strings.
* Very efficient trick!
